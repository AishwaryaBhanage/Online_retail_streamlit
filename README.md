##  End to End Streamlit Application on Product recommendation using Apriori

Problem Statement:
            Many consumers struggle with creating an efficient and comprehensive shopping list, often resulting in missed 
                items during the shopping process. The aim is to develop a solution that recommends top 5 frequently bought
                items based on the selection of one item from a list, facilitating a more thorough and convenient shopping experience.

Purpose:
             To create a user-friendly application that utilizes the Apriori algorithm for product recommendation and cross-selling,
                 ultimately assisting users in building a well-rounded shopping list.

Goal:
             Accepts a user's selection of a product from a list.
             Applies the Apriori algorithm to recommend the top 5 frequently bought items associated with the selected product.
             Provides the user with a selection mechanism among the recommended products.
             Allows the user to add the chosen product to their shopping list.

Tools and Technologies:
Python 3.10.10
Jupyter Notebooks
VS Code
